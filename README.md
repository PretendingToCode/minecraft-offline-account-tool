# Minecraft Offline Account Tool

A program used to automatically and safely create new versions folders with set account names

Usage: node createAccount.js [version] [username] [launcher name] [output directory]

Output directory option doesn't always work due to system permissions, but if it fails it will leave the folder in .minecraft\versions
